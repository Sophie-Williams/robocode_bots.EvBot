= Version  4.5.16 =

Reversion: pifGun and botStats comparison essentially reverted to v4.5.11 
parameters. It seems to increase APS.


= Version  4.5.15 =

Feature: rammer avoidance with danger map motion, also probing points are now
do not span beyond enemy bot: the normally circled area squashed in enemy
direction.

= Version  4.5.14 =

pifGun use only longest matches ends. Close to v4.5.11 logic


= Version  4.5.13 =

Bug fix: pidGun drawing polished and fixed
Improvements: dangerMap motion in 1on1 has flexible distance to probe, there
are bots which like to fight in closer distance, and old long and fixed probe
distance were a bad choice.
Added: skipped turns stats

= Version  4.5.12 =

pif improvements: working with all pattern length points (probabilistically),
speed up (do not check the same pattern points on the higher depth level).

= Version  4.5.11 =

Bug fix: distance to wall ahead used ineffective algorithm which leaded to
long execution times and skipped turns

= Version  4.5.10 =

Bug fix: introduced in 4.5.9 where I moved to new form of time stamps. 
Bug fix: in random future target position offset to avoid bullet shielding
bots
Various small improvements in logic.

= Version  4.5.9 =

PIF gun takes in account wall proximity, some improvements and bug fixes in
bot stats tracking. PIF gun in 1on1 like fights.

Enable PIF gun for 1on1

= Version  4.5.7 =

Enemy wave shows guess factor danger.

Added ramming of week bots (<0.1 energy) in 1on1.

Made a exact safe path calculation but it is to slow to be used. Need to
improve selection algorithm. 

Motion helper function moved to special helper class.
Makefile can compile for one version but put bot into other robocode
directory.

= Version  4.5.6 =

Move a variable from int to double.
Added tactics to penetrate bullet shielding bots: aim a bit off center.
Changelog itself reworked.

v4.5.2 melee success seems to be an artifact of low statistics.


= Version  4.5.5 =

Weight of enemy energy for targeting is set to constant equal to 1. This should
mimic logic of v4.5.2

= Version  4.5.4 =

Reduce weight of far targets, to match it to the v4.5.2 with exception that
energy of the enemy bot makes contribution to its weight. Idea behind that if
an enemy bot is far enough, the probability to hit is small. So even if it
tempting to fire at 0 energy bot, we might reconsider.

Hit wall now, throw a message to remind me to rework motion.

Small reworks in danger map motion.


= Version  4.5.3 =

bug fix: energy is used as part of weight for target choosing

placement statistic works properly 

= Version  4.5.2 =

bug fix: shadow bullets had unlimited precursor range

gf gun kicks in only in 1on1 settings, it seems to performe worse on most of
the bot except Neuromancer

Compile for robocode version 1.8.2


= Version  4.5.1 =

bug fix: when decided on fight type the ratio was 2/3 instead of 2./3 to
convert it to float

bug fix: typos in fight types
feature: different fight types have different sets of gun firing at me

= Version  4.5.0 =

Added gfGun firing at me in attempt to make GF profile flatter. Seems to help
a bit.

= Version  4.4.9.1 =

Added file log output.  Random gun is removed, added GF gun to middle melee
fight.

= Version  4.4.9 =

bug fix: do not chose point candidate at which my bot hits a wall

bug fix: choice of new gun if current is cold for too long
improved GF depiction for the GF paint method

= Version  4.4.8 =

GF gun use the most probable location.
Put random gun back for 1on1 situations.

= Version  4.4.7 =

bug fix: all my wave in air were removed once the first one hit

added: nice guess factor graphics for GF gun

= Version  4.4.6 =

GF gun fix. My hit bullet were not counted in GF stats.
My wave does not go beyond the 2 closest bot. Since it is unlikely that the
further ones  react on my shots.

= Version  4.4.5 =

Added guess factor gun.

= Version  4.4.4 =

Bug fix: linear or circular gun never settles if an enemy bot quickly oscillates.

= Version  4.4.3 =

Speed up on enemy wave danger calculations. Do not take in account waves which
a too distant.

Remove bullets screened/shadowed by enemy bot.

= Version  4.4.2 =

Comment out code of my bullets shadows

= Version  4.4.1 =

Added shadowing by my bullets and other bots bodies.

= Version  4.4.0 =

Circular gun is now a default, linear gun is not used anymore.

= Version  4.3.9.1 =

Bug fix for too many calls of getOthers()

= Version  4.3.9 =

Match condition of melee for v4.3.2 and 1on1 for v4.3.8

= Version  4.3.8 =

Redo danger from bullets, it is not as sharp dependence on their damage

= Version  4.3.7 =

Danger zone from bots is as in v4.3.2

Added danger from bullet proportional to its potential damage.

= Version  4.3.6 =

Gun distance to energy method is the same as in v4.3.2 for melee types

= Version  4.3.5 =

Brought back firing energy coefficient as it was in v4.3.2 except 1on1 melee
end where it is smaller.

Increased danger zone around enemy bot. 

Fix of battle won count.

= Version  4.3.4 =

1on1 and melee resulting in 1on1 are treated differently. 

Look like it is a good choice to chose stronger bullets in 1on1.


= Version  4.3.3 =

In melee fight fire power is 3, it is boosted up for other fights as well.

= Version  4.3.2 =

Bug fix: wall danger increased for no go wall zone, so bot does not bump at
walls.

= Version  4.3.1 =

Target selector takes in account enemy bot energy and how tough is the bot
(i.e. how long it lives in general on the battle field).

Bug fix of non firing gun. if bullet asks more than energy available than no
fire was set, now it takes almost all available energy


= Version  4.3.0 =

Nothing major just changed distToProbe 50 -> 100. This seems to help with
score.

= Version  4.2.9 =

Radar does much smaller motions to refresh positions of all bots. Radar code
is much simpler now as well.

= Version  4.2.8 =

Gun weight influence target choice only in the mid melee stage.
Before it switched on at the beginning of melee. It seems that 
it is the must to shot nearby bots at the beginning.


= Version  4.2.7 =

Target choice not only on distance but gun stats input.
Improved gun stats output.

= Version  4.2.6 =

Random gun switches on only in 1 on 1 fight, otherwise I use only linear
Improved gun stats output

= Version  4.2.5 =

In each fight style guns chosen according to probability to hit a bot with
this gun

= Version  4.2.4 unreleased =

Explicit sets of guns for 1on1, melee, and melee Midle battle type.

Disabled pifGun for now since it is too slow.

Improvements in the gun stats output.

Preliminary work to make target choice based on relative hit rates.

= Version  4.2.3 =

The pattern search depth is limited to constrain the time per turn and avoid
to many skipped turns. 

= Version  4.2.2 =

Bug fixes and speed up in play forward gun. It now looks for the longest
match.

= Version  4.2.1 =

Bug fix: ignore the heading of an enemy bot body in the predictor, 
look only for actual velocity direction

= Version  4.2 =

Added play forward gun and only it is used in the battle

= Version  4.1.1 =

Increased danger from other bots back to 100

= Version  4.1 =

Put fires from other bot through predictor of my own guns: linear and base (head on)

= Version  4.0 =

Added randomness and arbitrary amount of move point candidates

Track multiple bots now

= Version  3.9.4 =

Bug fix: when ramming was pulled into the enemy bullet path

Ramming weak opponents, and dynamic choice of distance in 1 vs 1

= Version  3.5 =

Improved linear predictor to place target within bot physical limitations.

Simplify and speed up danger map calculations.

Increase danger distances from bot and bullets.


= Version  3.4 =

Bug fix of the random gun.

= Version  3.3 =

Guns accumulate statistic during the battle. Based on it
I added performance based choice of available guns for 1 vs 1 stage.

= Version  3.2 =

Incidental release of the same version as v3.1

= Version  3.1 =

Bug fix: choice of new destination point

Now we chose among several cell with about the same danger level, no switch
to new destination if it is still reasonably low in danger level.

= Version  3.0 =

Movements are handled with danger map

= Version  2.1 =

Added a bullet manager to visualize all known bullets

= Version  2.0 =

Gun, radar, bullets, and motion moved to separate classes

Otherwise operational logic is the same as in v1.7

= Version  1.7 =

Quite good robot with almost all methods in one body

= Version < 1.0 =

Very naive robot with changes lost in history :)
