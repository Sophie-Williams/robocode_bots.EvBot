= Version  4.4.0 =

Circular gun is now a default, linear gun is not used anymore.

= Version  4.3.9.1 =

Bug fix for too many calls of getOthers()

= Version  4.3.9 =

Match condition of melee for v4.3.2 and 1on1 for v4.3.8

= Version  4.3.8 =

Redo danger from bullets, it is not as sharp dependence on their damage

= Version  4.3.7 =

Danger zone from bots is as in v4.3.2
Added danger from bullet proportional to its potential damage.

= Version  4.3.6 =

Gun distance to energy method is the same as in v4.3.2 for melee types

= Version  4.3.5 =

Brought back firing energy coefficient as it was in v4.3.2 except 1on1 melee
end where it is smaller.
Increased danger zone around enemy bot. 
Fix of battle won count.

= Version  4.3.4 =

1on1 and melee resulting in 1on1 are treated differently. 

Look like it is a good choice to chose stronger bullets in 1on1.


= Version  4.3.3 =

In melee fight fire power is 3, it is boosted up for other fights as well.

= Version  4.3.2 =

Bug fix: wall danger increased for no go wall zone, so bot does not bump at
walls.

= Version  4.3.1 =

Target selector takes in account enemy bot energy and how tough is the bot
(i.e. how long it lives in general on the battle field).

Bug fix of non firing gun. if bullet asks more than energy available than no
fire was set, now it takes almost all available energy


= Version  4.3.0 =

Nothing major just changed distToProbe 50 -> 100. This seems to help with
score.

= Version  4.2.9 =

Radar does much smaller motions to refresh positions of all bots. Radar code
is much simpler now as well.

= Version  4.2.8 =

Gun weight influence target choice only in the mid melee stage.
- Before it switched on at the beginning of melee. It seems that 
  it is the must to shot near by bots at the beginning.


= Version  4.2.7 =

Target choice not only on distance but gun stats input.
Improved gun stats output.

= Version  4.2.6 =

Random gun switches on only in 1 on 1 fight, otherwise I use only linear
Improved gun stats output

= Version  4.2.5 =

In each fight style guns chosen according to probability to hit a bot with
this gun

= Version  4.2.4 unreleased =

Explicit sets of guns for 1on1, melee, and melee Midle battle type.
Disabled pifGun for now since it is too slow.
Improvements in the gun stats output.
Preliminary work to make target choice based on relative hit rates.

= Version  4.2.3 =

The pattern search depth is limited to constrain the time per turn and avoid
to many skipped turns. 

= Version  4.2.2 =

Bug fixes and speed up in play forward gun. It now looks for the longest
match.

= Version  4.2.1 =

Bug fix: ignore the heading of an enemy bot body in the predictor, 
look only for actual velocity direction

= Version  4.2 =

Added play forward gun and only it is used in the battle

= Version  4.1.1 =

Increased danger from other bots back to 100

= Version  4.1 =

Put fires from other bot through predictor of my own guns: linear and base (head on)

= Version  4.0 =

Added randomness and arbitrary amount of move point candidates
Track multiple bots now

= Version  3.9.4 =

Bug fixes:
- when ramming was pulled into the enemy bullet path
- do not fire when low on energy

Disable ramming. It seems to decrease my score against low end bots

Makefile done differently for test version of bot

= Version  3.9 =

- Track enemy target hit rate.
- Optimize distance to increase mine/enemy hitRate ratio.

= Version  3.8 =

Increased threshold for ramming. Bug fixes in dynamic distance calculation.

= Version  3.7 =

Bug fix: when we are in mêlée reset dynamic distance calculation

= Version  3.6 =

Ramming weak opponents, and dynamic choice of distance in 1 vs 1

= Version  3.5 =

- Improved linear predictor to place target within bot physical limitations.
- Simplify and speed up danger map calculations.
- Increase danger distances from bot and bullets.


= Version  3.4 =

Bug fix of the random gun.

= Version  3.3 =

Guns accumulate statistic during the battle. Based on it
I added performance based choice of available guns for 1 vs 1 stage.

= Version  3.2 =
Incidental release of the same version as v3.1

= Version  3.1 =

Bug fix: choice of new destination point

Now we chose among several cell with about the same danger level, no switch
to new destination if it is still reasonably low in danger level.

= Version  3.0 =
Movements are handled with danger map

= Version  2.1 =
Added a bullet manager to visualize all known bullets

= Version  2.0 =
Gun, radar, bullets, and motion moved to separate classes

Otherwise operational logic is the same as in v1.7

= Version  1.7 =
Quite good robot with almost all methods in one body

= Version < 1.0 =
Very naive robot with changes lost in history
