Bug fix: choice of new destination point

Now we chose among several cell with about the same danger level, no switch
to new destination if it is still reasonably low in danger level.

= Version  3.0 =
Movements are handled with danger map

= Version  2.1 =
Added a bullet manager to visualize all known bullets

= Version  2.0 =
Gun, radar, bullets, and motion moved to separate classes

Otherwise operational logic is the same as in v1.7

= Version  1.7 =
Quite good robot with almost all methods in one body

= Version < 1.0 =
Very naive robot with changes lost in history
