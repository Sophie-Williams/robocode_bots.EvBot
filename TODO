* !important: make distance to probe enemy distance depended, some simple bots
  win over me just because they keep closer distance for example mz.AdeptBSB
* do not recalculate pattern in pif calcTargetFuturePosition method, reuse found ends
* instead of moving danger in front of enemy wave, calculate hit position at radius
  where my bot is now +/- some distance and use it in the danger map calculation.
* improve wall avoidance by taking in account stop distance or better yet by do proper 
possible track calculation. This will help to do true goto surfer.
* check why my bot does not fire at low energies around or less of 1
* many bots when low on energy stop firing, use it to shorten the distance
* see some logic to speedup screening/shadowing
* feature: make pifGun faster - keep track of known pattern and iterate from them
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its hit rate on me
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its survivability
  good bot last longer, so if I can use their fire count as a measure of their class.
* feature: change to smaller bullets if hit rate is small, at the end of the game
  there are larger losses from gun energy drain than enemy hits
* fine-tune distToProbe in danger map it looks like changing it from 50 to 100 increases
  1on1 score, look at it at melee as well
* Fix typo in meelee1on1 --> melee1on1 fight type name
* look at v3.9.4  and see how come it performs so good in melee, with it unsophisticated
  motion algorithm and lack of enemy bullets avoidance

= Completed =
* add anti bullet shield tactics for 1on1 i.e. fire slightly off enemy bot center 
  or even just enable random gun.
* check that on actual my bullet hit it is counted into guess factor stats.
* feature: make shadow bullets - safety zone in the wave where it passed through enemy bot wave
  make sure that shadowing area taken in account
* feature: make shadow bullets - safety zone in the wave where it passed through enemy bot
* fix: make sure that danger of points near the border is super hight for distances
  smaller than bot half width. MyBot often select a forbidden point when pressed to the wall
  by enemy bullets.
* fix: do proper switch of target not only its name
* feature: make target choice based on distance AND hit weight probability
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans minimal needed angle to see all bots
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans when gun is too hot
