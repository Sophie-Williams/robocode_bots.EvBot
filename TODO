* feature: make pifGun faster - keep track of known pattern and iterate from them
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its hit rate on me
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its survivability
  good bot last longer, so if I can use their fire count as a measure of their class.
* feature: change to smaller bullets if hit rate is small, at the end of the game
  there are larger losses from gun energy drain than enemy hits
* tune distToProbe in danger map it looks like changing it from 50 to 100 increases
  1on1 score 

* look at v3.9.4  and see how come it performs so good in melee, with it unsophisticated
  motion algorithm and lack of enemy bullets avoidance

= Completed =
* fix: do proper switch of target not only its name
* feature: make target choice based on distance AND hit weight probability
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans minimal needed angle to see all bots
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans when gun is too hot
