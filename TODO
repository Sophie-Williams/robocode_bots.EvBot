* check what is going on with robophysics firing bullets. Recall gun fires first if it can and 
  only than rotates. See http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Game_Physics#Firing_Pitfall
* track enemy gun heat status and start wave when its cold this is super important in melee
  where it is impossible to track all bot simultaneously.
* decide what to do with bullet intercepted waves
* do not add bullet still flying to the fired count, otherwise hit probability is
  calculated to be smaller than actual. This  is small correction (4 bullet at most) 
  and it is only important at the beginning of the game.
* in danger map motion do not shrink search distance in direction away from enemy
* see if flexible distance to probe will help in melee too
* instead of moving danger in front of enemy wave, calculate hit position at radius
  where my bot is now +/- some distance and use it in the danger map calculation.
* improve wall avoidance by taking in account stop distance or better yet by do proper 
possible track calculation. This will help to do true goto surfer.
* check why my bot does not fire at low energies around or less of 1
* many bots when low on energy stop firing, use it to shorten the distance
* see some logic to speedup screening/shadowing
* feature: make pifGun faster - keep track of known pattern and iterate from them
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its hit rate on me
* feature: make bot danger proportional to its survivability
  good bot last longer, so if I can use their fire count as a measure of their class.
* feature: change to smaller bullets if hit rate is small, at the end of the game
  there are larger losses from gun energy drain than enemy hits
* fine-tune distToProbe in danger map it looks like changing it from 50 to 100 increases
  1on1 score, look at it at melee as well
* Fix typo in meelee1on1 --> melee1on1 fight type name
* look at v3.9.4  and see how come it performs so good in melee, with it unsophisticated
  motion algorithm and lack of enemy bullets avoidance

= Completed =
* !important: see why calcTargetFuturePosition called twice per turn for pifGun and may be
  others
* !important: increase conner danger in 1on1, often my bot pushed in the conner,
  which reduces MEA
* !important: do not recalculate pattern in pif calcTargetFuturePosition method, 
  reuse found ends. It is done twice during virtual bullet fire and during real target track.
  On top of it probabilistic gun will give differnt position with every calculation. Use cashed
  values.
* see what degraded performance between v4.5.11 and v4.5.12:
  prinniung/cleaning points for out of bounds check generated a lot of skipped turns, thus
  overall degraded stats
* add anti bullet shield tactics for 1on1 i.e. fire slightly off enemy bot center 
  or even just enable random gun.
* check that on actual my bullet hit it is counted into guess factor stats.
* feature: make shadow bullets - safety zone in the wave where it passed through enemy bot wave
  make sure that shadowing area taken in account
* feature: make shadow bullets - safety zone in the wave where it passed through enemy bot
* fix: make sure that danger of points near the border is super hight for distances
  smaller than bot half width. MyBot often select a forbidden point when pressed to the wall
  by enemy bullets.
* fix: do proper switch of target not only its name
* feature: make target choice based on distance AND hit weight probability
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans minimal needed angle to see all bots
* feature: redo radar sweep so it scans when gun is too hot
